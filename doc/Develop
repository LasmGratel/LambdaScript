differences with lua
-----
Common
No `lock' and `unlock'.

Memory
Use a usage int to indicate allocation strategy and memory type (memory allocate type).
Use a ArrayInfo structure to store array allocating information.
`memused' is the total memory usage but not that for data storage only.


todos
-----
Do gc in memory allocation functions.
Finish `ls_close'.
